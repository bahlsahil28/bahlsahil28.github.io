Taking  major step forward in the art of storytelling, Devdas attempted to move away from the theatricality that was prevalent at the time, and adopt a more realistic style.
Published in 1917 Sarat Chandra Chanpadyay's iconic Bengalis novel was first
adapted as a silence film in 1928, well before New Theaters studio remade it in Bengali and Hindi in 1935. P.C. Barua directed both of these versions and also played the lead role in
the Bengali film. The Hindi adaptation however, saw Kundan Lal Saical as the
doomed hero Devdas, unable to marry his childhood sweetheart. Parbati, who is forced to wed another man. Despite the best efforts of the courtesan Chandramukhi, whom he visits to get
over losing Parbati, Devdas continues to wallow in self-pity.
The film's rich cinematic treatment and eloquent dialogue established Barua as one of the best film-makers in India.

SINGING SUPERSTARS<br>
The film also made Saigal into a major star. His brooding looks, with the lock of hair falling across his forehead, and his voice full of love and despair, sent audiences into a frenzy. Ironically Saigal had a sore throat at the time of recording the songs for Devdas, forcing
him to sing in a softer voice, which matched Barua's naturalistic treatment of the story perfectly Saigal's singing in Devdas was ultimately recognized as some of the best of his career
Before selecting Jamuna Barua to play Parbati, the director had originally wanted the top singer and actress Kanan Devi to play the part, but her studio, Radha Films, refused to give her permission. Devi later found out that her contract had already expired, and that
Radha Films had conveniently kept silent about it. She subsequently signed up with
New Theatres and went on to make some of her best films with the studio.

INSPIRED ADAPTATIONS<br>

Over the years, the character of Devdas, the ultimate romantic, has continued to fascinate film-makers. Dilip Kumar play the tragic hero in a 1955 film, directed by Bimal Roy. Shah Rukh Khan took on the role in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic 2002 interpretation, while Anurag
Kashyap gave the tale a unique dark spin in Dev.D (see p.342), starring Abhay Deol. Earlier, in the 1970s, film-maker Gulzar had begun a version with Dharmendra, but it was never finished
